<aside> But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing of a pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</aside>

reflections:
-Semantics are tags with a meaning. They allows the browser and developer to know what the content inside the tags are.

-It goes renders them from top to bottom. Top gets rendered first and then bottom elements.

-Yes. But as of right now I don't have anything in my mind yet

-Hardest part for me was making the snippet. I think the instructions could go a little more detailed or let us do this before hand in another module.
